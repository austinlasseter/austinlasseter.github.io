I'm a software engineer and tech instructor located in Northern Virginia. Between 2018 and 2022, I've taught the full range of data courses with General Assembly
including data analytics (three times), Python programming (five times), and Data Science (over a dozen times).
A life-long learner, I love to share with my fellow students the latest advancements in automation of AI/ML in the AWS cloud.
I'm fascinated by the intersection of Software Development and Machine Learning!

My specialty is building and deploying machine learning
models with my students.

I love learning new ways to create digital products
with Amazon Web Services, and to share with others what I've learned and built.
In addition to my classes with General Assembly, I also work full-time as a software developer at a startup focused on AIOps.

I hold a PhD in Policy from the University of Maryland with a concentration in Survey Statistics, and 9 relevant certifications including the Amazon Machine Learning certification, the “Machine Learning Engineer” nanodegree from Udacity, and a certificate in Data Science from General Assembly.

When I'm not throwing it down with Python, you'll find me running marathons,
kayaking on the Shenandoah river, or rock-climbing in Great Falls!
